# Potran
The Potran programming language

## Why Python/LARK?
It was the most sensible option for creating the first versions of our compiler as it allows for quicker and more sensible development.

## Hello, World!
```p22
Program HelloWorld {
    Export Integer32::Function Main () {
        OutputLine "Hello, World!";
        Return 0;
    };
};
```
